Pokemon PWD Crack

- How to solve
First you need to determine the hash, using a tool like haiti will tell you it's NLTM.
Next, you need to use a Tool like CeWL to create a pokemon wordlist and write a python script to add a number between 10-99 to each Pokemon.

The command to run is hashcat -m 1000 [hashes.txt] [wordlist.txt]
