The text is blacked out and we need to reveal what is hiding underneath. Let's start by opening our favorite image editing tool (I will be using GIMP).

As you can see all I used was Exposure and increased it to the max setting to reveal what's under the highlighted text and we can piece together the flag to solve the challenge.
