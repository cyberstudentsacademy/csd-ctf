Take a look at the roadmap, do you think the food has something to do with him using the official accounts?

Looking around the website, we see that towards the bottom of the roadmap there are a couple of food pictures.

We can reverse Google image search the second image to see it is from **Black Cow Fat Pig Pub & Steak

Looking at reviews on Google maps, we see [this](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xWX8fnYCaiugUhno8) Google review posted recently.

In that food review we see *ibb.co/5TpZYpq* and going to it shows a food image with the flag.
