Using a tool like Google image barely gives results, when the image is put through a EXIF viewer you won't see any
metadata, but a little searching about the area finds us a place called Maheswara Maha Pyramid kadthal. with the same "I
love Patriji" on Google earth

Flag: csd{maheswara_maha_pyramid_kadthal} or csd{maheswara_maha_kadthal_pyramid}
